### PROJECT DESCRIPTION/OUTLINE:
This project will focus on vaccination rates for each of Chicago's zip codes as they compare to income per capita. 
The data sets we plan to use include:

1. City of Chicago COVID-19 Vaccine Doses by Zip Code https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Vaccine-Doses-by-ZIP-Code-At-Least-One-Do/c28u-q29v
    - analyze number of people in each zip code who have recieved at least one dose- bar chart by zipcode
    - percentage of people in each zip code who have received at least one dose
    - create a line graph that compares percentages


2. US Census Bureau API # Run Census Search to retrieve data on all zip codes (2013 ACS5 Census)
https://github.com/CommerceDataService/census-wrapper for library documentation
https://gist.github.com/afhaque/60558290d6efd892351c4b64e5c01e9b for labels
    - Average age for each Chicago zip code
    - Average household income for each Chicago zip code
    - heat map of average household income

### Questions we want to answer

    - Is there a correlation between average household income and percentage of population who have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine?

    - Why are certain zip codes receiving a higher percentage of vaccines than others? 
    
    - Is there a correlation between median age and % vaccinated per zip code?
